# 😄 SmileSchool Homepage – HTML & CSS Clone

Welcome to the **SmileSchool Homepage Clone** – a visually engaging and responsive front-end project built entirely with HTML and CSS. Inspired by a stunning [Figma design](https://github.com/samsonawe/alx_html_css), this project replicates the homepage of a fictional learning platform that teaches one thing well: **Smiling.**

## 🧠 What I Built

This is more than just a homepage. It's a pixel-perfect clone that uses:

* ✨ **Semantic HTML** – Clean, accessible structure.
* 🎨 **Pure CSS styling** – No frameworks, just good ol' handcrafted CSS.
* 📐 **Figma-to-Code precision** – Every section matches the original layout closely.
* 💜 **Inline touch** – The word “Learn” in “Learn from the pros” is styled purple with inline CSS, just like the original.
